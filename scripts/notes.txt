Note..we keep the bundle at the bottom of the text-file so that it renders last!

There were 2 options to rendering things..a JQuery, which renders on load?


importing and exporting is about where you need to use files

put files in a sub-folder, and have a main file from that subgile

//must load libraries in index html file
//look through D3 docs

//requires files in entry
//as soon as the window loads content, he sets up listeners

//window.documentLoaded will wait more time small difference
//look up ready state change
