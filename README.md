# CityBikeVisulization
MVP:

This app will allow for users to see daily citibike usage, as well as what direction CitiBike users are going in.  The directions will be 'uptown','downtown','or across-town.'  Users will be represented as dots on a Google Maps API.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs:

Not quite sure yet. I will obviously have to use the Google Maps API, but have not quite figured out the rest.

Wireframes:
  


Backend:
Other than the data from Citibike, there won't be a back end.

Implementation Timeline:

1st) Allow for one ride to be displayed on the Google Maps API 

2hd) Allow for multiple rides to be displayed on the Google Maps API

3rd: Allow for the additional visual features to be displayed, where you can see what direction cyclists are going based on their colors.
