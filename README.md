# Saturday In The City
  Saturday In The City visually displays taxi traffic as a representation of the movement in New York on a typical Saturday starting at sunrise at 5:25:00AM, and ending at sunrise on Sunday at 5:25:00AM the next morning.  
## About
  This visualization uses data from NYC Open Data to animate taxis as they drove on 6/6/2015.  Each circle on the map represents one single taxi-ride. Uptown rides are colored red; downtown rides are colored blue.  I assume that the driver drove the route recommended by Google Maps. The data is stored on Firebase to reduce the number of asynchronous requests that need to be made.

## Features
 1. Users can start / pause the animation
 2. Users can restart the animation
 3. Users can start the animation at any time within the 24 hour time cycle.
  
## Technologies Used


* Firebase
* Javascript
 

## Future Updates

The highest priority features is allowing both yellow and green taxis to be displayed.
